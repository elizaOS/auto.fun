# Trading

Trading is a core feature of the Auto.fun platform, allowing users to buy and sell tokens in a secure and efficient manner.

Auto.fun supports multiple trading mechanisms to accommodate different user needs:

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

The AMM is the primary trading mechanism on Auto.fun:

- **Liquidity Pools**: Pairs of tokens that enable automated trading
- **Constant Product Formula**: Uses the formula x * y = k to determine prices

### Order Book

For more advanced trading, Auto.fun also supports an order book:

- **Buy Orders**: Orders to purchase tokens at a specific price
- **Sell Orders**: Orders to sell tokens at a specific price
