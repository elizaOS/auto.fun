DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; MASS ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
This section is deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the US Federal Arbitration Act, and you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd each agree that this section is intended to satisfy the “writing” requirement of the US Federal Arbitration Act.
THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO WHICH YOU ARE CONSENTING CONSIST OF A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, MASS ARBITRATION PROVISION, AND A CLASS-ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, by using the platform, you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree that if a dispute arises between you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or the Released Parties arising out of or relating in any way to these terms and conditions or the platform or your use thereof, including common law or statutory claims, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW CLAIMS YOU AND ELIZA FOUNDATION OPCO LTD AND THE RELEASED PARTIES HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. You and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties arising out of or related to the platform, including any products or services offered or sold on the platform and your use of the platform, shall be resolved exclusively through confidential, final, and binding arbitration; provided that either party may file suit in court seeking to enjoin infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of its intellectual property rights. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
Arbitration Procedure
The arbitration will be conducted under JAMS’s Comprehensive Rules & Procedures, including the JAMS's Consumer Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The JAMS’s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings are available on the JAMS’s website at: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, territorial or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these terms and conditions is void or voidable.
The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location or by video at the election of either party. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, any party may elect to have the arbitration based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on the other party subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person or video hearing if the circumstances warrant. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. 
The arbitrator’s award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules.
Class Action Waiver 
You and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree that each of us may bring claims against the other or Released Parties only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree otherwise or the Mass Arbitration provisions set forth below are triggered, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect any other person or party. You and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd further agree that in the event this arbitration agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, the prohibitions on class and representative actions and non-individualized relief set forth in this paragraph are severable and shall apply to any claim between you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties in any forum. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.
Mass Arbitration
If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Demands or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties, and such circumstances meet the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (“Mass Filing”) set forth in National Arbitration & Mediation’s (“NAM”) Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing Rules”) available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree that JAMS shall not serve as arbitrator and that instead NAM shall administer any Mass Filing claims and the NAM Mass Filing Rules in effect at the time such claim is filed shall apply as modified below. The parties agree to the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator pursuant to NAM’s Mass Filing Rules, and additionally agree that the Procedural Arbitrator will have the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability including, but not limited to, any issue regarding the validity, existence, formation or scope of the agreement under which Arbitration is being sought, and the proper parties to the Arbitration. You agree that throughout this process, the parties’ counsels shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. You acknowledge and agree that your election to participate in a Mass Filing may result in a delay in the adjudication of your dispute with Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties.  Any applicable limitations periods and filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in the process set forth below.
Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties shall each select 15 claims per side (30 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd will pay the mediator’s fee.
Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd or Released Parties shall each select 20 claims per side (40 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd will pay the mediator’s fee.
If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:
Option One: You and we may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with these terms and conditions. You may opt out of arbitration by sending us your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by certified mail addressed to the Notice Address. Such an opt-out notice must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage Two or the elective mediation associated with Stage Two. We may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of our intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30-day opt out period. Counsels for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.
OR
Option Two: If neither you nor we elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsels for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims will be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsels for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator, as such term is used in the NAM Rules) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.
You and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd agree that each party values the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wishes to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between the parties. You and Eliza Foundation OpCo Ltd acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases. If any part of this Mass Arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the NAM rules, then the balance of this Mass Arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision was not contained herein unless the lack of such provision would lead this Mass Arbitration provision to fail of its essential purpose.
A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim will proceed before JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines (available at https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures). If a court of competent jurisdiction also determines that the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines are not enforceable as to your Claim, then the remaining Claims shall be subject to Option One or Option Two above as selected by you or us.
