// The chat page wraps the chat component with a left column that shows a list of all of the tokens on the platform that the user owns, and when they click on them, it shows that chat page

// We'll show the token name and ticker and image and then the chat below that on the right column, which will take up most of the space.

// There should be structured like a mix of Discord and Telegram with the tokens on the left and the separators between the gated chats on the top of the right column and the chat below that taking up most of the space.
